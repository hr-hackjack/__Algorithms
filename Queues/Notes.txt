Application of queue data structure
-------------------------------------

1. Single resource and multiple consumers - example ticket system, we book ticket in queue basis ie. first come first served or FIFO. 
Same happnes in Process scheduling in OS

2. Synchronization between slow and fast device. ex. between keyboard and cpu. all instructions go in the form of queue.
Same happens in networking when a high bandwidth network transmits information to a low bandwidth network, low bandwidth network 
cant consume all that data very fast. So there is router between the two, which takes data from high bandwidth network and keep it in the
form of queue and when low bandwidth network becomes available it takes accordingly.

3. Use of queue in OS -
    a) Semaphores - When a resource is not available the process goes into sleeping state, it resumes again when the resource 
    becomes available. This happens in the form of queue.
    b) Spooling
    c) FCFS scheduling
    d) Buffers for devices like keyboard

List and deque are the container which provide implementation for queue. By default it has deque implementation
Vector was there for stack but not in queue because vectore does not provide pop_front functionality
