1. Degree of nodes - no. of children a node has
2. Nodes which have degree zero is called leaf node
3. Nodes which have degree > 0 are called internal nodes

Application of tree data structure-
---------------------------------
1. used to represent hierarchical data
ex - organisation structure, folder structure, html/xml content, in inheritance(OOPS)

2. Binary search tree (imp)
3. Binary heap
4. B and B+ trees in dbms for indexing
5. spanning and shortest path trees in computer network
6. parse tree, expression tree in compilers used to parse src code

Variations of tree-
--------------------
1. Trie - used to represent dictionary. also support prefix search
2. Suffix tree - used to do fast searching in string
3. Binary index tree - used for range query searches
4. Segment tree - used for range query searches

Tree traversal -
--------------
1. Breadth First traversal - (Level order traversal) - traverse each level line by line from left to right
2. Depth First traversal - there are 3! permutation but most common are below three
    a. inorder - LNR
    b. preorder - NLR
    c. postorder - LRN
